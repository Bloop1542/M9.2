## Overview

This is a simple program/game where the player uses their curser to control an
"evil" ball that destroys all the other balls floating around the screen. 

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:

- Used this guide for to get the evil circle to follow the mouse: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
- I had some help from github copilot as well as a friend that helped me with 
the shape class
